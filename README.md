# ROS2 Driver

Taken from the official repository of [OxTS ROS2 Driver](https://github.com/OxfordTechnicalSolutions) and added the compatibility to Humble.

Follow instructions in the official repository to build it.

While cloning, give the url for [this](https://github.com/avinashumeshsarma/oxts_ros2_driver_humble) repository instead.

The repository would also be used for the integration of the INS sensor to Autoware.
